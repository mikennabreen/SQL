-- For this project, I downloaded the Chinook database from Kaggle 
-- I answered 14 questions for my Final SQL Project that reinforces all the SQL concepts I have learned throughout my course.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'US';

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
-- The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices;

-- Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
-- The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.invoiceID
FROM chinook.employees emp
INNER JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepID
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;

-- Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.employees emp
INNER JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepID
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;

-- How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

-- What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

-- Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT inv_items.InvoiceLineId, tr.Name
FROM chinook.tracks tr

-- Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT inv_items.InvoiceLineId, tr.Name, art.Name as Artist_Name

ON inv_items.TrackId = tr.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON alb.AlbumId = tr.AlbumID

-- Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

ON alb.AlbumId = tr.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.media_types med
ON med.MediaTypeId = tr.MediaTypeId

-- Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2)
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepID
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

-- Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, SUM(inv.Total)
